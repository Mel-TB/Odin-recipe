    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <em> This general tso’s cauliflower is so crispy, delicious, and spicy-sweet! And it’s just as good as the fried
            version, while being so much healthier! Welcome to cauliflower heaven!! </em></p>

    <p> You guys went absolutely crazy about the cauliflower hot wings I posted on the blog a couple of weeks ago. In
        just a little over a month, they became one of the most popular recipes on the blog. And this is well-deserved.
        They’re sooo good! The recipe for the general tso’s cauliflower is actually similar to that of the cauliflower
        hot wings. However, the sauce and therefore the taste is totally different! While I used spicy BBQ sauce to coat
        the cauliflower hot wings, this recipe calls for homemade general tso sauce made with rice vinegar, ginger,
        garlic, and soy sauce.</p>
